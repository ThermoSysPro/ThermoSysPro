*Warning*: the **ThermoSysPro** official repository has been moved 👉 [official repository](https://gitlab.pam-retd.fr/thermosysproandco/ThermoSysPro).

You will find there the last releases 🚀 and you will have a better view of ongoing developments 🏃 and of our roadmap for the future ↗️. We strongly recommend you to join us on the official repository for any interaction 📞 (see our [contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.pam-retd.fr/thermosysproandco/ThermoSysPro/-/blob/master/ContributionsWorkflow.md?ref_type=heads))... but we keep this repository on GitHub to ease reporting for external contributors, if needed. 😉
