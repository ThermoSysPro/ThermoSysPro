## About ThermoSysPro

[ThermoSysPro](https://thermosyspro.com) is a library providing model components for thermal hydraulics, instrumentation and control. It has been developed in the Modelica language from the [Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org).

The library is released under the open source [Modelica License 2](https://www.modelica.org/licenses/ModelicaLicense2) and can be used for teaching, academic and industrial purposes.

ThermoSysPro has been mainly designed for the modeling and simulation of thermal power plants of all kinds (nuclear, fossil fuel fired, solar, biomass, combined heat and power…), but can also be used for energy systems at large such as heat networks or industrial processes.

## Current release

Current release of ThermoSysPro is v4.0.

## Compatibilities

ThermoSysPro v4.0 is developed on Dymola using MSL 4.0.

## Documentation, book and website

The library documentation is available at [https://thermosyspro.gitlab.io/documentation](https://thermosyspro.gitlab.io/documentation).\
The book [Modeling and Simulation of Thermal Power Plants with ThermoSysPro](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030051044) describes in depth the physics at stake in the library.\
